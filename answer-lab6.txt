Question 1
How did you structure your transmit implementation? In particular, what do you
do if the transmit ring is full?

e1000_tx()在发现队列已满之后，会返回-E_TXQ_FULL这一错误值。在output.c中的output()中
27行附近，当sys_net_send的返回值小于0，output()检查它是否等于-E_TXQ_FULL，若是，则重
试直至sys_net_send成功调用并返回；若不是，则panic。

Question 2
How did you structure your receive implementation? In particular, what do you do
if the receive queue is empty and a user environment requests the next incoming
packet?
