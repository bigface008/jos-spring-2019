1. What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the
same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not
be provided?)
只有一个处理函数的话，不push错误号的处理器就分辨不了错误类型了。（？）

2. Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave
correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault
(trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt
vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14
instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is interrupt vector
14)?
不需要。错误号是系统产生的，不能由应用自己产生（指dpl为0的），所以一旦应用int $14，就会
被判定为general protection fault。如果允许的话就会按照正常的page fault的处理过程走一
遍。
